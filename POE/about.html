    <h1>About Mzansi Fresh Market</h1>
    <div class="card">
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
       Mzansi Fresh Market was born from a simple idea: bring quality, affordable groceries to the heart of South African communities. Founded in 2025 by a group of township entrepreneurs and tech-savvy visionaries, the first store opened in Soweto with crates of fresh produce, a kota stand, and a mission to uplift local suppliers. What started as a single outlet quickly grew into a network of community-powered markets across Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Eastern Cape.
